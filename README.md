# Bio Tech: Multi-Bio Identification System

**Bio Tech** is an innovative **Multi-Biometric Identification System** combining **Fingerprint Recognition** and **Face Recognition** to provide high-accuracy, real-time authentication — even when one modality fails.

> **Built with EfficientNet, OpenCV, face_recognition, Flask, and Firebase.**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

Traditional biometric systems fail due to injuries, lighting conditions, or spoofing attacks.  
**Bio Tech** solves this by combining multiple biometrics (fingerprint + face) to create a **robust, reliable, and user-friendly authentication system**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 **Dual Authentication**: Fingerprint + fallback to Face Recognition.
- 🎯 **High Accuracy**: EfficientNetB0 fingerprint model (~89% accuracy).
- 📸 **Real-Time Identification**: Face recognition via live camera feed or static image.
- 🔄 **Fallback Mechanism**: Auto-switch if fingerprint fails.
- ☁️ **Firebase Integration**: Secure storage for user profiles and embeddings.
- 🖥️ **Lightweight Web Interface**: Built using Flask (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).

🛤️ Workflow
📑 Fingerprint Enrollment & Authentication
Upload fingerprint via Flask app.

EfficientNetB0 model predicts identity.

Fingerprint features stored in Firebase.

📸 Face Enrollment & Authentication
Upload or capture live face image.

Generate 128-dimension face encoding.

Compare uploaded/captured face with database encodings.

🔄 Multi-modal Authentication
If fingerprint confidence is low, fallback to face recognition for identification.

⚙️ Implementation Details
Fingerprint Identification
Preprocessing: Resize images to model input size.

Model: Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0.

Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy.

Optimizer: Adam.

Face Recognition
Library: face_recognition (built on dlib).

Encoding: 128-dimensional face vectors.

Matching: Euclidean Distance (threshold ≈ 0.6).

Flask App
Routes for registration, login, fingerprint upload, camera capture.

Secure API endpoints for Firebase communication.

Firebase
Storage: Fingerprint and face images.

Realtime Database: User profiles, fingerprint embeddings, and face encodings.

🎯 Objectives
Combine fingerprint and face recognition for robust authentication.

Achieve high accuracy even if one modality fails.

Provide real-time, seamless, and user-friendly authentication.

Enable cloud-based secure storage and management.

💡 Unique Selling Points (USP)
✅ Dual-mode fallback authentication.

✅ Deep learning-powered fingerprint recognition.

✅ Free Firebase backend for real-time data management.

✅ Deployable with basic hardware (camera + simple scanner).

✅ Lightweight and simple Flask-based web app.

📈 Impact
Higher Reliability: Face recognition acts as a backup if fingerprint fails.

Enhanced Security: Dual biometrics reduce chances of spoofing.

Cost-effective: No need for expensive specialized hardware.

Real-Time Access: Users can authenticate remotely.

Would you also like me to give you these extras (optional but highly professional):
- `requirements.txt` file 📦
- `project folder structure` diagram 📂
- `firebase_config.py` template 🔥

It will make your repo 100% ready and perfect if you plan to showcase it or submit it! 🚀  
Should I prepare that too?
